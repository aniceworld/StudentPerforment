# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes student performance data to explore how demographic and behavioral factors influence academic achievement. It includes a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `StudentsPerformance.csv`: Original dataset containing scores and demographic information for students.
- `EDA.ipynb`: Python notebook for data exploration, visualization, and key insight generation.
- `Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard visualizing key metrics and trends.

---

## 🧪 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **Gender**
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Parental Level of Education**
- **Lunch Type**
- **Test Preparation Course**
- **Math Score**
- **Reading Score**
- **Writing Score**

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):

- Correlation between subjects
- Score distribution across gender and race
- Impact of parental education level on performance
- Effectiveness of test preparation course
- Top insights on students' strengths and weaknesses

📌 Sample Insights:

- Students who completed the test preparation course scored **10–15 points higher** across all subjects.
- Female students scored higher on **reading and writing**, while male students had a slight edge in **math**.
- Higher parental education levels are associated with better overall student performance.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Key visualizations included:

- Average scores by gender, race, and parental education
- Subject score comparison and correlation
- Distribution of test preparation course completion
- Interactive filters by demographic factors

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Demographic factors** like race and gender play a visible role in score distribution.
- **Parental education level** strongly correlates with student outcomes.
- **Test preparation** programs are effective and may deserve more institutional focus.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate more student-level behavioral data (attendance, homework completion)
- Apply machine learning models to predict high/low performers
- Deploy dashboard using Power BI online or Streamlit for wider access
